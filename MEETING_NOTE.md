1. Highlights
    - Weekly meeting if possible (Thu)
    - Changes on the schedule/work items (To be discussed)
    - The proposal aims to work on an overall performance framework, whereas the original initiative is to identify performance changes when a single SecRule is updated (e.g., regex changes). We will focus on a single SecRule first, which can be extended to an overall performance test.
    - The initiative of the framework is to be flexible enough to adapt to other WAFs (e.g., Coraza). In the first stage, We will start with ModSecurity 2.9.
    - As a public-facing application, testing the functionality is essential. (Adds into the schedule)

2. Ideas
    - Performance tests cannot rely on a single payload. Fuzzing might be a good way to yield multiple payloads to support the test
    - Before the development, defining the matrix we want is necessary. Meanwhile, we also need to consider what matrix/data we can get.

3. To-dos
    - Review/update the proposals.
    - Establish a work environment. (ModSecurity 2.9)
    - Research on existing performance testing framework.
    - Reading documentations.
